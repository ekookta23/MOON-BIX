## Introduction to Moonbix by Glitch

Moonbix automates gameplay by mimicking human behavior, ensuring your activity appears natural. To prevent abuse and safeguard against unusual API requests, the latest version now requires a license key for activation.

### How to Get Started:

1. **Generate Your License Key**  
   Visit [@automation_tools_bot](https://t.me/automation_tools_bot) on Telegram. Use the `/help` command to find the "Generate Key" option.

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Run the following command in your terminal or Termux:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/scriptvip/MOON-BIX
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Directory**  
   ```shell
   cd MOON-BIX
   ```

4. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set Up Your QueryID's**  
   Open the `tokens.txt` file using a text editor (e.g., nano):
   ```shell
   nano tokens.txt
   ```

6. **Start the Bot**  
   Run the main script to begin:
   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

7. **Apply the License Key**  
   - In the menu, press `2` to edit the configuration and enter your license key.
   - To finalize, press `1` to apply the key.
   
8. **Start Earning!**  
   Once everything is set up, select the "Start Bot" option in the main menu to activate the bot.

## Running 24/7

For continuous operation, you can deploy the bot script on a VPS/RDP. If you're using a Linux-based system, the `screen` application can keep the bot running in the background, allowing it to operate 24/7.
